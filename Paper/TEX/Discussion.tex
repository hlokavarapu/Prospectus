In reservoir models, the mantle is often considered as a homogeneous reservoir however OIB and MORB samples show distinct groups plotted in $\eta_{Nd}$ versus $^{87}Sr/^{86}Sr$ ~\cite{WWM:2015}. Due to the volumetric differences on OIB and MORB volcanism, I propose subdividing the mantle into two reservoirs.
