Atmosphere*
Scaling the carbon concentration presently in Venus's atmosphere to Earth's atmosphere gives a total carbon mass of $^cM_{a} = 1.28 \times 10^8$ Gt. 

Core*
Therefore, we treat the core as an isolated reservoir with no influence on any other reservoirs of carbon post moon-forming impact. Estimates for the abundance of carbon in the core is based on a chondritic model. The uncertainty in estimates of carbon abundance in core encapsulates the sum of carbon in all other reservoirs presently.

Mantle*
In our own model, we consider the whole mantle as a single reservior due to the uncertainties in the distribution and abundance of carbon in the mantle.
