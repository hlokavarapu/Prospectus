At present day, 99\% of carbon is predominantly stored in the continental crust, core and mantle. The abundance of carbon in surficial reserviors such as the atmosphere and oceans is relatively insignificant. However,~\citet{SNH-ZK:2001} hypothesize a high abundance of carbon in the atmosphere during Earth's early history. Scaling the carbon concentration presently in Venus's atmosphere to Earth gives a total carbon mass of $^cM_{a} = 1.28 \times 10^8$ Gt. They suggest that this carbon mass has been fractionated into the mantle and the continental crust after the moon-forming impact. An alternative source of carbon in the continental crust may have been the mantle as a result of a higher flux of volcanism relative to subduction. In order to test the possibility of either source of carbon in the continental crust, we construct a carbon reservoir model evolving from the moon-frming impact to present time. Preliminary results indicate that either source of carbon in the continental crust is viable. In the future, I propose testing the viabilty of a combination of both sources to build the carbon content in the continental crust.

Reservoir modeling is a well-utilized tool in chemical geodynamics. However, there is a lack of easy-to-use, accessible, flexible and well-documented reservoir modeling code. In order to fill this gap, I propose to build a python based library consisting of the following modules: reservoirs, fluxes, assembly and solution of ODE system, and visualiztion of results. The reservoir module will consist of an associated mass for the single element or isotope concentration. The fluxes consist of a source function, two end member reservoirs, and direction of transport. This allows for an arbitrary number of reservoirs and fluxes to be specified. Once the model has been constructed, the resulting ODE system will need to be assembled and solved for. Lastly, a user-friendly visualization toolkit to help analyze the results is important whether that includes plotting or mere access to teh raw data. In order to verify the viablilty of the proposed framework, one idea is to implenet other established reservoir models as examples.
