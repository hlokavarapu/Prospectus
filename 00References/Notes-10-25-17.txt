- The ocean is a key player in the carbon cycle
- It is possible to measure the recyclaing rate based on stronium 86, 87 isotope ratios
- Continental crust is heterogeneous
- 20 % of sediments are being deposited due to the monsoons and himalayas.
- Pelagic sediments - open ocean, physical weathering  
- Why not sample shales?
- lead isotope reservoir
- Meteroitic line 
- lack of greenhouse gases leads to snow ball earth
