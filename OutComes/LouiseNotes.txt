Did you have others to add?

·      Consider incorporating a flux from Urey reaction to subduction directly (another arrow)

·      Include some availability of silicate for weathering curve – frame it as that and not as continental growth curve - second order approximation

·      Consider talking about sensitivity of models to uncertainties – “this may be the most interesting part” – Dawn.

·      Committee had some confusion, but mostly a great deal of interest about the relative timescales of the pre-continental crust vs. the rest of Earth history. I suggest following up with additional conversations with Dawn and Max.
